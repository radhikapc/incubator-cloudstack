  <title>Persistent Networks</title>
  <para>The network that you can provision without having to deploy a VM on it is termed persistent
    network. A persistent network can be part of a VPC or a non-VPC environment.</para>
  <para>Previously, a network is only a database entry until the first VM is created on that
    network. When the first VM is created, a VLAN ID is assigned and the network is provisioned.
    Also, when the last VM is destroyed, the VLAN ID is released and the network is no longer
    available. With the addition of persistent network, you will have the ability to create a
    network in &PRODUCT; which can run even when no VMs are running. Additionally, you can deploy
    physical devices on that network.</para>
  <para>The main advantage of having a persistent network is that you can create a VPC with a tier
    consisting of only physical devices. For example, you might create a VPC for a three-tier
    application and deploy VMs for Web and Application tier, and use physical machines for the
    Database tier.</para>
