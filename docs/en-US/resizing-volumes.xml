  <title>Resizing Volumes</title>
  <para>&PRODUCT; provides the ability to resize data disks; &PRODUCT; controls volume size by using
    disk offerings. This provides &PRODUCT; administrators with the flexibility to choose what they
    want to make available to the end users. Volumes within the disk offerings with the same storage
    tag can be resized. For example, if you have defined a 5 GB and a 10 GB disk offerings, a user
    can upgrade from 5 GB to 10 GB. If you have made a custom-sized disk offering available, then
    you have the option to resize the volume by specifying a new, larger size. Additionally, a data
    volume can be moved from a static disk offering to a custom disk offering with the size
    specified. This functionality allows those who might be billing by certain volume sizes or disk
    offerings to stick to that model, while providing the flexibility to migrate to whatever custom
    size necessary.</para>
